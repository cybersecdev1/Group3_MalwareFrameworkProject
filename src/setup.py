# An Account is the account on the Exchange server that you want to connect to. This can be
# the account associated with the credentials you connect with, or any other account on the
# server that you have been granted access to. If, for example, you want to access a shared
# folder, create an Account instance using the email address of the account that the shared 
# folder belongs to, and access the shared folder through this account.
